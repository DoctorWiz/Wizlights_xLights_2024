Is this the yuletide
It's such a mystery
Will I be denied
Or will there be gifts for me

Come down the stairs
Look under the tree and see---

I'm such a bad boy
I get no sympathy
Cause I've been raising cain
Raising hell
Don't behave
Very well

Waiting for the sleigh bells
Christmas really matters to me---
To--- me---

Santa---
Been really bad
Been writing on the wall
Broke a window with my ball
Santa---
Christmas coming soon
But now I've gone and thrown my toys away
Santa--- Ooo-ooo-ooh
I want to see the reindeer fly
If you're not down my chimney by tomorrow
Gonna cry, gonna cry
Cause Christmas really matters

Too late
Yuletide is come
Hanging stocking by the fire
Singing carols with the choir
Goodnight everybody
It's time for bed
Gotta listen for the reindeer on the roof
Santa--- Ooo-ooo-ooh
Listening for the sleigh bells
I just wanna try
Sometimes wish I'd never been bad at all

I see a jolly silhouetto of a man
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Will you come down my chimney
Donner and Blitzen, Cupid and Vixen, please
Pull the sleigh-o
Pull the sleigh-o
Pull the sleigh-o
Pull the sleigh-o
Santa please don't give him coal
Give him coa-oa-oal
I'm such a bad boy
Nobody loves me
He's such a bad boy
From a bad family
Big chunks of coal should go under his tree

Raising cain, raising hell
Please don't give me coal
Kris Kringle
No---
Do not give him coal
Give him coal
Kris Kringle
Do not give him coal
Give him coal
Kris Kringle
Do not give him coal
Give him coal
Do not give him coal
Give him coal
Do not ever give me coal---
No No No No No No No
Come on Santa Come on Santa
Santa please don't give me coal
Saint Nicholas has a lump in his sights
For me, For me, For me

So you think you can snub me and give me no gifts
So you think you can put me on your bad boy li-st
Oh Santa
Can't do this to me Santa
Just gotta be nice
Just gotta be nice for next year

Ah do, ray me

Christmas really matters
Anyone can see
Christmas really matters
Christmas really matters
To me---

Waiting for the sleigh bells
